# EmojiMixer
 An app that mixes emojis using Google Emoji Kitchen API mainly inspired from [emojimix](https://tikolu.net/emojimix/).
 The project is just broken since I'm not active anymore to fix it, I appreciate every contribution especially the ones that help to make the app more consistent.

## To-do
- [ ] Emojis sliders. (still broken and needs improvements).
- [ ] Better URL checking system. (current system is fine but it doesn't fetch all emojis).
- [ ] Export mixed emojis as WhatsApp/Telegram stickers.
## Disclaimer
This app uses Google Keyboard emoji kitchen API and all emojis generated in the app are by Google.
